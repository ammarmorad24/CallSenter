# CallSenter
"CallSenter" helps solving the problem of foreign-language speaking customer and local agents so we design a chat interface that does real-time translation so this solves the problem of paying more to bilingual agents after the chat we do a sentiment analysis and push the sentiment to an AirTable database to track KPIs and help empower the organization
