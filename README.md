# CallSentier 📞💡

## 🔎 Project Overview
**CallSentier** is a cloud-based customer support solution designed to break the language barrier between customers and agents.  
The idea is simple but powerful:
- Customers can speak in their own language (e.g., English, French, Arabic).
- Agents can respond in their own language.
- A cloud-based translator bridges the gap, translating in real time so neither side needs to learn the other’s language.

This project was developed during **[Bootcamp Name]**, where we had the opportunity to learn from outstanding instructors and apply those lessons in a real-world team project.

## 🚀 Features
We didn’t stop at translation — we designed a complete workflow to generate business value:
- **Real-time translation** between agents and customers.
- **Sentiment analysis** for every conversation.
- **Automated storage** of chats and sentiment results in Airtable.
- **Data export** to Excel automatically.
- **Live dashboard** that refreshes with every new interaction (PowerBI).
- **Automated reports** sent via email to managers (daily or weekly).
